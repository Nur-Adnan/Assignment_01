          Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.
          Don’t be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other
          people’s thinking.

            I am a doctor - it's a profession that may be considered a special
            mission, a devotion. It calls for involvement, respect and
            willingness to help all other people.

          <p class="paragraph">
            If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it
            would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel’s heartbeat,
            and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of
            silence. George Eliot

            "If you’re bored with life – you don’t get up every morning with a
            burning desire to do things – you don’t have enough goals." –Lou
            Holtz Having goals that we are passionate about gives us something
            to look forward to each and every morning when we wake up. Not
            having goals is an excellent recipe for average living.

          Protect your enthusiasm from the negativity and fear of others. Never

          can. You would be surprised at what "little" acts have done for our
          world.

          I think actually if you take the analogy with other areas of
          engineering, and increasingly of science and even mathematics, you can
          see people do not have to learn the vast number of formulae they used
          to learn. Instead, they have to learn to use the computer effectively.
          This frees them, I feel, to understand concepts and the foundations
          while they’re learning the mechanics of the application of the theory.
